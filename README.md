# Pyforms


Pyforms is a Python 2.7 framework to develop GUI application, which promotes modular software design and code reusability with minimal effort.
### It offers:
* A Python layer of Windows forms, based on PyQT, OpenGL and other libraries.
* A group of rules and methodologies that help the developer maintaining his code short, clean, reusable and readable. 

## Advantages
* With a minimal API, windows interfaces are easily defined using a short Python code.
* Avoid the constant switching between the PyQt designer and the Python IDE.
* It is designed to allow the coding of advanced functionalities with a minimal effort.
* The code is organized in modules and prepared to be reused by other applications.
* It makes the applications maintenance easier.
* Turn the prototyping much easier and fast.
* Due to its simplicity it has a low learning curve.
